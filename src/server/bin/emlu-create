    Notes:

        Two paremeters:
            - Origin folder
            - Destination (mount point)
        Check that both exists.
        Check that not in fstab.
        Ask for password.
        Append line to fstab.
        Append id to root sig-cache.
        Append descriptor to EMLU config file.
